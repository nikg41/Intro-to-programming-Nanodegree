        <h2 id="lesson-1-1"> How the Web Works </h2>
        <div class="code">
        <p>
          The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with
          each other. When a person goes to a web page like
          www.google.com, their computer sends a
          <em>HTTP Request</em> to
          a <em>server</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
          it back to the user's computer where a <em>
          web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it on
          the user's screen.
          <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496">This video</a>
          does a good job of explaining more.
        </p>
      </div>
<h2 id="lesson-1-2">WORLD WIDE WEB</h2>
<div class="code"><p>World wide web is accomplished of many HTML pages.Where HTML stands for <em>hypertext markup language</em>.Today we consist of more than <em>30 billion </em> Pages on World wide web.
  This language is used interpret the web pages.It consist of three parts <em>Client(user),Internet ANd The Servers</em>.
The <b>Http</b> is used to interect all this 3 components of WWW.
</p></div>
<h2 id="lesson-1-3">Tags and Elements</h2>
<div class="code"><p>HTML documents are made of HTML <em>elements</em>. When We are
  using HTML, we tell browsers type of each element we have used in the document by using HTML <b>tags</b> Used in the file.
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723444">This video</a>
  explains the distinction well.
</p></div>
<h2 id="lesson-1-4">Why Computers are Stupid</h2>
<div class="code"><p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
  literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a
  small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
  in a program.</p>
  <p>
  When We say to it That we met that guy there.
  it interpret it that only and don,t think that we met whom and where
  he only does the things by himself what we only told and don,t think about it once.
</p></div>

<h2 id="lesson-1-5">Inline vs Block Elements</h2>
<div class="code"><p>HTML elements are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them.
  in inline we have bold tag,italic tag,span tagand many more whereas in block tag we have paragraph tag,div tag and many others which we learn further about that things in future.
</p></div>
<h2 id="lesson-1-6">HTML attributes</h2>
  <div class="code"><p>
    Some tags in the HTML can accepts the <em>attributes</em> i thier openings.This are used to make the text better and to add the src of some files in it,which we want to use
    Here anchor tag have <b>href</b> as an attribute.Image tag have <b>src</b> as an attribute to add palace from where the image is <em>loaded from</em> and us int it.
    </p></div>

      <div class="concept"><h1 id="lesson-2">Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h1></div>
      <h2 id="lesson-2-1">Developer Tools(In Browser)</h2>
    <div class="code">  <p>HTML elements are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>. Block
        elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
        them.
      </p></div>
      <h2 id="lesson-2-2">HTML's "tree-like" Structure</h2>
      <div class="code"><p>
        The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML
        elements can have other elements inside of them. You can
        draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother
        had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
      </p>
      <p>
        In a browser, this structure shows up as a series
        of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes
        inside of boxes, and so on...
      </p></div>
      <h2 id="lesson-2-3">Indentations and Boxes</h2>
      <div class="code"><p>
        When you read an HTML document as
        <em>text</em>, you see a wave of
        changing indentations going up and down the left side
        of the document. The more indented an element is, the
        more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.
      </p></div>
      <h2 id="lesson-2-4">Text Editors(Used For Programing)</h2>
      <div class="code"><p>
        When writing code, programmers use special text editors
        (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the
        programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors
        will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you
        write an opening tag.

      <h2 id="lesson-3-1">Avoiding Repetition(same properties in html)</h2>
      <div class="code"><p>
        Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Avoiding Errors:</b> When programmers <em>don't</em> avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Consistency:</b> In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson <span class="code">div</span> the same <span class="code">class</span> and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetion, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.
      </p></div>
      <h2 id="lesson-3-2">Cascading Style Sheet</h2>
      <div class="code"><p>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <span class="code">class</span> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.
      </p></div>
      <h2 id="lesson-3-3">Coding Resources</h2>
      <div class="code"><p>
        The following coding resources will help me learn to "think like a programmer":
